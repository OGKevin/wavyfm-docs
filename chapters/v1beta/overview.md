This chapter includes the reference of the `v1beta` API version. It should be noted that this is a **beta** version,
so endpoints and resources may be sparsely documented.

Since this is the first API version, some endpoints described here are still in development and may be completely
inaccessible. Once the API is deemed complete and documented fully, it will be promoted to `v1`.

You can learn more about versioning in the [API Reference](../intro/api).
